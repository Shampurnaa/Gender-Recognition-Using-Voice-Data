# Gender-Recognition-Using-Voice-Data
Predict gender from voice using TensorFlow. Data collection, CNN, and traditional NN. Preprocessing, model training, bias evaluation. Voice-based gender recognition for various applications.This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing gender recognition from voice data using machine learning techniques. The notebook provides implementations using both dense neural networks and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Notebook

### Gender Recognition From Voice Data.ipynb

This notebook covers:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset (`voice.csv`)
- Encoding labels using `LabelEncoder`
- Standardizing features using `StandardScaler`
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Training a dense neural network model for gender recognition
- Evaluating the model performance on the test set
- Implementing a 2D CNN model for gender recognition
- Visualizing the input data for the CNN model
- Training the CNN model and evaluating its performance

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gender-recognition.git
    ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
    - You can open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Usage

This template can be used as a starting point for implementing gender recognition models on voice datasets. Customize the code as needed for specific projects or experiments.

## Acknowledgments

- The initial template was automatically generated by Google Colab.
- The dataset used (`voice.csv`) is assumed to be provided separately.

Feel free to explore and modify this notebook according to your requirements. Happy coding!
